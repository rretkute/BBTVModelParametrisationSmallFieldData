# Parameterisation of epidemiological models from small field experiments: a case study  of banana bunchy top virus transmission
We develop a novel Bayesian framework that  combines adaptive multiple importance sampling with data augmentation technique. We illustrate this approach on real data from a small-scale field study of the transmission of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV).
